          <p1><br>Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of combining a real-world environment with enhancements provided by computer-generated (CG) perceptual information. Unlike VR, AR is not a  completely immersive, virtual experience. Virtual objects or displays lay over the real world with positional tracking, typically through a set of smart glasses, goggles, a monocle, or an HMD .This technology is especially useful for military and medical purposes as both require much focus and information in high-stress, timely scenarios.
            L&D understands the needs and challenges of working with AR. With tools like Unity, we will provide you with content that feels natural and realistic. Additionally, L&D can develop AR for all available headsets. Whether it is medical simulation, maintenance trainers, or enhancements, the limits of AR are boundless.

          <p1><br>VR is a fully immersive experience composed entirely of computer-generated environments and objects or 360º videos. So, what this means is, the term "virtual reality" can only be applied to programs that completely change the environment around the user. To explain, Virtual Reality is created by using sensory stimulators to trick the user’s brain into believing they are in a separate reality. This can be accomplished by using headsets known as head-mounted displays (HMD).

              <p>
                Simulators are intended to train users for a certain role in a partially virtual environment. Trainees utilize the augmented reality in these solutions to learn the vital skills needed for a new job. They replicate real-life situations, which makes the learning experience more retainable and engaging.

          <h2>Defence</h2>
          <h3><span>Defence Division of Lux & Decibels</span></h3>
          <p1><br>Lux and Decibels is a technology-driven company committed to creating a combat training VR environment for our Country’s Bravehearts at a fraction of the cost compared to the present simulated training concepts.
            We are specializing in the core technology such as:
            •	Augmented Reality (AR), 
            •	Virtual Reality (VR), 
            •	Assisted Reality
            •	Mixed Reality (MR)
            •	X -Reality (XR)             
          </p1>
        </div>

        <div class="row content">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p1>X-Reality technology is the latest in the world. XR allows near, real multi-sensory experiences that create an unprecedented training experience. Lux & Decibels is based at Chennai, India and has a facility in Europe too. We have been in the technology field for over 2 decades and are in the forefront of technological advances. On top of that, thanks to our experience of working with other Indian defence establishments like the Navy, and Army just like you, we understand the ground reality standing in your way to those outcomes.
            </p1>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p1>Based on the information that we have obtained so far; we’ve outlined our primary goals as below:
              •	Training of troops in an environment of current weaponry.
              •	Training of troops in newly procured weaponry.
              •	High costs of training in terms of spent ammunition, wear and tear of weapons.
              •	Constant need for refresher training of troops to keep them in a battle-ready format.
            </p1>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row content">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p1>
              <br>Lux and Decibels wish to create a world-class virtual reality-based training program for the Indian Defence establishment. The program will help train troops in simulated real war-like conditions in a virtual environment with a real feel of weapons and other dimensions via simulation. By use of Artificial intelligence, the troops would be able to see other men and enemies alike in the virtual world and we can create the following sensory conditions: -
•	Temperature – Heat and Cold
•	Smell of cordite and nitroglycerin
•	Real sounds of firing weapons and other explosions
•	Real feel of the recoil of guns, main guns of tanks, artillery guns, etc.
            </p1>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p1>
              Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the process can even simulate the heat generated inside a battle tank and real weather-based temperatures like in the western borders or the eastern sector or any environment. 
It’s been acknowledged that the cost of mock yet realistic combat training with real gear, weaponry, ammunition, and simulated conditions can run into a few lakhs or to even crores every time.  Hence using our custom-designed training module will help impart the cutting-edge skills needed to react in a real battlefield scenario. 
We are confident that this independent training module with artificial intelligence will help bridge the gap in training and provide constant feedback matrix on battle preparedness.
